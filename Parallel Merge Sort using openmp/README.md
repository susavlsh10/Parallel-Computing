Parallel Merge Sort using openmp

![Parallel Merge Sort](https://github.com/susavlsh10/Parallel-Computing/blob/main/images/MergeSort.png)


To compile and execute the code, use the commands:

icc -qopenmp -o sort_list_openmp.exe sort_list_openmp.c
./sort_list_openmp.exe k q

where k and q are integer arguments that specify the number of elements in the list n = 2^ùëò, and the number of threads p = 2^ùëû.


The following graph shows the speedup vs q for different values of n.

The following graph shows the efficiency vs q for different value of n.

Analysis

The data illustrates the speedup ratios for parallel execution of merge sort using OpenMP, comparing it to sequential execution across various values of k and q. The speedup ratio, defined as single-thread time divided by multi-thread time, displays certain trends. For fixed k, the ratio generally rises with increasing q until it peaks, after which it declines. This suggests that adding more threads enhances performance up to a point, beyond which it introduces inefficiency. Similarly, for a constant q, the speedup ratio typically increases as k grows, emphasizing the benefit of parallelization for larger list sizes.
